== todos ==

== maybe do ==

add mplayer cross option

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)

make march work with ffmpeg/x264
 compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything

make the static vs. shared builds "a command line option/prompt"

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)

== really maybe, as in probably never ==

add openmp, for libsoxr? (and one other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

check march=native (from laptop...)
  ffmpeg more? do I need to enable runtime detection when it's not? 
  libx264 still uses i686?
  more march stuff in "notes" file

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

cleanup zeranoe suggs (from our chat)

parameters to the script
  an option to setup-compilers --arch

warn that we're not using it if they already have a toolchain in the PATH

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

--extra-ffmpeg-options


"shared" builds option, like libavcodec-54.dll

complain for "everyone" that fails cross compile that I haven't yet...

march=native (others? vpx?)

dynamic aac somehow...prolly for something with > 2 audios...

see if it "builds ok" 64 bit with out the path or ABI thing

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm

test timings for first failure commits bisect-like[?]
  test really old with -threads 6...

does it affect "both" libx264 and/or just ffmpeg?
    Also, I wonder if x264 needs to be recompiled after every update to
    test? Does this issue root in FFmpeg or x264 possibly?

--disable-decoder=libvpx ?

not require prompts at all for the compiler
try and figure out if its pthreads that's giving me the speedup over his

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath

use make -j 2 (more than one core)

x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
