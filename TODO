make march work with ffmpeg/x264

make static vs. shared builds "a command line option"

vpx is still messed up (?)/respond to their response...

distribute  "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)

research: https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/apps-devel/ZZ2an44u3X0

prefer polarssl to gnutls for smaller exe? wait can ffmpeg use polar

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...

libvpx
  fix, update blog (somebody left a comment)/vpx ML
    threading/configure?

check march=native (from laptop...)
  ffmpeg more? do I need to enable runtime detection when it's not? 
  libx264 still uses i686?
  compare 64 vs 32 bit speedz...
  more stuff in "notes" file

cleanup zeranoe suggs (vpx?)

parameters to the script
  an option to setup-compilers --arch

warn that we're not using it if they already have a toolchain in the PATH

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

--extra-ffmpeg-options

== maybe/never do ==

"shared" builds option, like libavcodec-54.dll

complain for "everyone" that fails cross compile that I haven't yet...

march=native vpx (others?)

dynamic aac somehow...prolly for something with > 2 audios...

see if it "builds ok" 64 bit with out the path or ABI thing

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm

test timings for first failure commits bisect-like[?]
  test really old with -threads 6...

does it affect "both" libx264 and/or just ffmpeg?
    Also, I wonder if x264 needs to be recompiled after every update to
    test? Does this issue root in FFmpeg or x264 possibly?

--disable-decoder=libvpx ?

not require prompts at all for the compiler
try and figure out if its pthreads that's giving me the speedup over his

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath

use make -j 2 (more than one core)

x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
