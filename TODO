== actual todos ==

libdvdnav [read?] for vlc
not do march stuff...

== maybe do ==
libav with nonfree?

don't "always install libavcodec" [only when building VLC, maybe only ffmpeg]

VLC is missing a few things...like libdvdnav :P

VLC, you should use ../plugins/accessibility [?]
  you should also not use plugins [?]

complain on anybody that I have to sed their .pc files [yikes!]

add vid.stab support?
  check for any other configs he uses?

fix all that are hard coded revision checkouts...meh

make a prompt for "shared or not?"

I may not be using my "suggested super CFLAGS" everywhere quite right, should add to everywhere?

warn on old yasm from the get go...tell them to update to Raring :) meh

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)
  tell them? others that require tweaks also?

make march work with ffmpeg/x264
 compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)
  move all downloads to some place I control...maybe even "all" downloads LOL
    old downloads to sourceforge [?]

make it compilable on windows native...
  release a downloadable "click here to run it" to build full libfdk-aac on windows LOL

release "some 10 bit, some not" ?
  command line?

release some compiler optimized? does it make a difference? real installer?
  ancient debug builds, etc...hmm...sourceforge for legacy? yeah

add openmp, for libsoxr? (any other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

march=native (others? vpx?)

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm

test timings for first failure commits bisect-like[?]
  test really old with -threads 6...

does it affect "both" libx264 and/or just ffmpeg?
    Also, I wonder if x264 needs to be recompiled after every update to
    test? Does this issue root in FFmpeg or x264 possibly?

not require prompts at all for the compiler
try and figure out if its pthreads that's giving me the speedup over his

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath

x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
