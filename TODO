== actual todos ==
 --cflags=-march=k8-sse3 at least build, run with mine...amd?
   clean sandbox build all with libfdk

== maybe/never do ==

mplayer 32 bit cross compile with CFLAGS=-march=core-avx2 and with postproc possible?
  maybe after get mplayer git working?
  tell mplayer about it? is it just cross compiling [compiled for 64 bit linux seems to not fail]? compiled for 32 bit linux with march=iav7 or what not worked...current guess is an mplayer bug :|

a distro that's a VM they can just open up and hit "go" in :)

test all things dvd to make sure they play anything...

submit dvdread gcc_pack upstreams [?] and static linking, after checking SVN

can I take out the wine unset MARCH's? I don't know if it will matter much though they do clutter...hmm...
mplayer git'ify'
  blocked'ish

vlc git'ify
  blocked :P

-d should auto select "both 32 and 64 bit" [XXX make it into command line param too?]

command line option "don't update any git repos"

libav work with nonfree? meh

don't "always install libavcodec" [only when building VLC, maybe only ffmpeg too]
  or smaller?

VLC, you should use ../plugins/accessibility [?]
  you should also not use plugins [?]
  after investigate more, does it use them now? meh

complain on anybody that I have to sed their .pc files [yikes!]

add vid.stab support?
  check for any other configs he uses?

fix all that are hard coded revision checkouts...meh

SDL check if has same bug with 2.0, if so then file it...

Qt check if same weirdness with 5.1, if so then file it...

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)
  tell them? others that require tweaks also?

make march work with ffmpeg/x264
 compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything
  then with profiled LOL

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)
  move all downloads to some place I control...maybe even "all" downloads LOL
    old downloads to sourceforge [?]

VLC: more qt patches
  make distro smaller [?]
  make sure it can use libx264 so it benefits from march=native :P

make it compilable on windows native...
  release a downloadable "click here to run it" to build full libfdk-aac on windows LOL

release "some 10 bit, some not" ?
  command line?

release some compiler optimized? does it make a difference? real installer?
  ancient debug builds, etc...hmm...sourceforge for legacy? yeah

add openmp, for libsoxr? (any other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

more march stuff...today we have the namsy pamsy enable cpu detection stuffs :P

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm [?]

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath? f full program?
  x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
