libdvdnav [read?] for vlc
not do march stuff...yet :P at all, just let it sit...enable cpu runtime detect for now

== maybe do ==

mplayer git'ify'

libav with nonfree? meh

don't "always install libavcodec" [only when building VLC, maybe only ffmpeg]

VLC, you should use ../plugins/accessibility [?]
  you should also not use plugins [?]
  after investigate more, does it use them now? meh

complain on anybody that I have to sed their .pc files [yikes!]

add vid.stab support?
  check for any other configs he uses?

fix all that are hard coded revision checkouts...meh

make a prompt for "shared or not?"

I may not be using my "suggested super CFLAGS" everywhere quite right, should add to everywhere?

warn on old yasm from the get go...tell them to update to Raring :) meh

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)
  tell them? others that require tweaks also?

make march work with ffmpeg/x264
 compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything
  then with profiled LOL

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)
  move all downloads to some place I control...maybe even "all" downloads LOL
    old downloads to sourceforge [?]

make it compilable on windows native...
  release a downloadable "click here to run it" to build full libfdk-aac on windows LOL

release "some 10 bit, some not" ?
  command line?

release some compiler optimized? does it make a difference? real installer?
  ancient debug builds, etc...hmm...sourceforge for legacy? yeah

add openmp, for libsoxr? (any other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm [?]

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath

x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
