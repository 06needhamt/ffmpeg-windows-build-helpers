This helper script lets you compile locally a windows 32 bit version of ffmpeg.exe,
including some dependency libraries.

In a Linux box (VM or native):

first download it (git clone the repo,  or)

$ wget https://raw.github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers/master/cross_compile_ffmpeg.sh

$ chmod u+x cross_compile_ffmpeg.sh

cd to where it is, if necessary, then run

And follow the prompts.
Enjoy!
